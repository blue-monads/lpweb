# lpweb

lpweb is a way to access http service though libp2p.
This allows to expose your http service even if you only have private ip like services running in your local machine or your home rapPi.
It gives you domain name using your libp2p public key.

<libp2p_key_hash>.lpweb

browser => ( proxy_or_extension_with_libp2p) => (another_libp2p_node_with_http_service)

> But you need access to both ends, run tunnel on one side and use proxy on other 

```bash

# target machine
lpweb http-tunnel --port=4000 # where 4000 is port you want to tunnel, your websevice/ dev port / python3 -m http.server

# go run main.go http-tunnel --port=4000 # same as above

# another machine
lpweb web-proxy --port=8080 # 8080 is a proxy port, use in browser/networking

```

## TODO
- [x] websocket support
- [ ] ~~bring back DHT, currently it cheats by using etcd discovery for finding peer address and connect with libp2p (DHT was flaky cz new address would take time to propagate ðŸ¤· )~~ remove etcd discovery, currently its is used to pass lowercase(hash), save that info in DHT or libp2p gossip
- [ ] webextension someday ðŸ¤ž (browser extension would route <hash>.lpweb traffic through js impl of libp2p hence no need to run seperate proxy)


## Run in seperate host

```bash


docker run -it golang:1.21

apt update && apt install -y tmux && git clone https://github.com/blue-monads/lpweb && cd lpweb && git checkout mj-packet-splitter

tmux # Ctrl+b " -> to split screen

python3 -m http.server # in one tmux shell

mkdir -p /root/.config/lpweb/

/usr/local/go/bin/go run main.go http-tunnel --port=8000 # in another tmux shell
